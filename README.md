## Installation
To install Redfields, download the GitHub .zip file and extract it on your device. 
You will also need to install RayLib as a library to run the game:

Make sure to extract both RayLib and Redfields. 
Raylib only needs to be somewhere on your computer for the game to use it.

Launch "primary.exe" in the Redfields folder, which will launch the game.
Please post any bugs or difficulties you experienced and I will do my best to solve them.

## How to Play
### Gameplay
The game is simple: survive up to 12 waves of a variety of enemies with your elite sword skills. 
Avoid large natural objects that annoyingly block your path while Nickelodeon hunts you down.
Defend against boss and challenge waves that make survival all the more difficult.
Level up as you gain experience from defeating enemies, making you stronger the longer you fight.
Upgrade your sword to defeat the strongest of enemies.
Choose between 4 modes of difficulty, each far more challenging than the last.
Prove your worth to see if you are the greatest swordsman who ever lived.

There are two sword attacks you can use: slash and stab.
Slash attacks are the basic attack, they will apply normal damage and knockback with the normal cooldown.
Stab attacks will only apply 75% damage with a longer cooldown, but yield more knockback.

Every three waves, the game alternates between boss waves and challenge waves, starting with a boss wave (i.e. wave 3: boss, wave 6: challenge, wave 9: boss, wave 12: challenge).
A boss wave consists of bodyguard enemies, followed by a boss to spawn at the end.
Challenge waves, on the other hand, are waves that rush you with extra-powerful enemies.

The store can be accessed by touching the totem in the middle of the map BETWEEN WAVES.
The store will not open during a wave.
To exit the store, just walk away from the totem (do not press esc, as it will close the game).
The store will display your current level and how much gold you have.
There are 4 different swords in the game, each better than the last.
You start with one, and by spending gold, you can upgrade your sword if your level is high enough.

There are a variety of enemy types that each drop different amounts of xp and gold, as well as some other rare drops such as extra health.
Better drops require defeating better enemies.

How the difficulties compare when using the goblin's health as a reference:

Easy: 2

Medium: 3

Hard: 4

Joaquin: 6

### Controls
Movement is wasd, as most games. 
Exiting the game is by clicking the x or pressing esc. 
The slash attack is left click, while the stab attack is right click. 
To choose the difficulty at the beginning of the game, press the number that corresponds to that difficulty (e.g. for easy, press 1).
Press spacebar to start the next wave.

### Strategies
If you can't beat the first boss on easy: skill issue.
