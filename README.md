## Installation
To install Redfields, download the GitHub .zip file and extract it on your device. 
You will also need to install RayLib as a library to run the game:
https://www.raylib.com/

Make sure to extract both RayLib and Redfields. 
Raylib only needs to be somewhere on your computer for the game to use it.

Launch "Redfields.exe" in the Redfields folder, which will launch the game.
Please post any bugs or difficulties you experienced and I will do my best to solve them.
